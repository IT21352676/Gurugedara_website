            In Sri Lanka, the current inclusive education system struggles to
            effectively support students with learning disabilities due to a
            lack of specialized teaching methods, resources, and awareness.
            Financial constraints and a general lack of understanding among
            parents often result in misdiagnosis or complete neglect of these
            conditions, causing affected children to fall behind academically
            from the primary level.
